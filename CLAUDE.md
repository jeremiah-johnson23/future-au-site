# Future AU (Podcast Site)

Before starting any work, read these files from the simon-context repo (`~/simon-context/`):

1. **BRIEF.md** - Voice, tone, and working preferences
2. **PROJECTS.md** - Active project status and priorities
3. **DECISIONS.md** - Settled decisions (do not relitigate)

## Repo Context

Future AU is a monthly podcast on Australia's future through data-driven analysis. Currently pre-launch with no episodes recorded yet. Equipment purchased.

This is a creative outlet, not a revenue play (Decision #7). Early content develops voice, not audience (Decision #11). Monthly cadence: 1 podcast episode per month (Decision #9).

Keep the site clean and functional. The content should demonstrate novel perspectives, not rehash conventional takes (Decision #8).
