<!-- Newest sessions first (prepend new entries above this line) -->

## Session 1: Signup section redesign & cleanup (2026-02-13)

Redesigned the "Get the Inside Story" signup section — replaced CSS card mockup with AI-generated phone image (Gemini), then pivoted to a cleaner two-column layout with headline, form, and 4 preview items. Removed redundant "Don't Just Listen" final CTA (duplicate signup). Simplified host section to solid gold background (removed teal diagonal). Moved signup section below topics for better flow. Simon works fast and iterates visually — prefers seeing changes live then directing adjustments. Next session: domain setup, deploy to Cloudflare, begin first guest outreach planning.
